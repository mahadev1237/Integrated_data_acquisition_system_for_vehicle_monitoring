An Integrated Data Acquisition System (IDAS) for vehicle monitoring is designed to collect, process, and display real-time data from various sensors installed in a vehicle. This system helps monitor temperature, light intensity, and time, ensuring the vehicle functions efficiently and safely.

System Components and Their Roles
1. Microcontroller (LPC2129)
   ✔ Acts as the central processing unit of the system.
   ✔ Collects data from sensors and processes it for display.
   ✔ Interfaces with external components using UART, I2C, and SPI communication protocols.
2. Sensors for Data Collection
   ✔ MCP9700 (Temperature Sensor)
       -> Measures ambient or engine temperature.
   ✔ LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
       -> Detects ambient light for automatic headlight control or dashboard brightness adjustment.
3. Communication Interfaces
   ✔ UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
       -> Transfers sensor data to external devices.
   ✔ I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
       -> Connects to the Real-Time Clock (RTC) for accurate timekeeping.
   ✔ SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
       -> Interfaces with an External ADC for high-precision sensor readings.
4. External ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
   ✔ Converts analog signals from sensors into digital values for processing.
5. Real-Time Clock (RTC)
   ✔ Keeps track of time and date in HH:MM:SS AM/PM, DD/MM/YYYY format.
   ✔ Ensures accurate time stamping of recorded data.
6. LCD Display:
   ✔ Displays real-time sensor readings, including temperature, light intensity, and time (HH:MM:SS AM/PM format).

Applications in Vehicle Monitoring
✔ Engine Temperature Monitoring 
      -> Prevents overheating and improves performance.
✔ Automatic Headlight Adjustment 
      -> Uses LDR to control lighting based on ambient conditions.
✔ Real-Time Alerts & Display 
      -> Provides drivers with immediate feedback.
✔ Data Logging for Diagnostics 
      -> Helps in predictive maintenance by analyzing sensor trends.
